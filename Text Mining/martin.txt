1080685|55546|164|12|22|1|0|6.67|5|NonRx:medicine & health:condoms, fertility & pregnancy tests:condoms & contracept|Sheer Glyde|These have been a wonderful addition to our relationship. For many reasons you may desire a barrier. These are far superior to the old standard dental dam; in fact there isn't a comparison to the two. They provide complete coverage, are ultra thin and are next to nothing. The flavors are subtle and pleasing. We recommend a small amount of silicon lube under it.

The cloths are very thick and soft, and they clean and deodorize the skin thoroughly without any irritation. The best thing about these cloths is that they're UNSCENTED. The other Comfort Bath cloths (in the slightly paler blue packaging and in the Value Size box) have a strong and somewhat unpleasant fragrance.

It has a nice flavor, not sweet like alot of other teas out there.@My whole labor (first pregnancy) lasted about 3 hours, and it might have been due to this tea. Baby was born totally healthy. I really believe the statement that it tones and strenghthens the uterus-- mine seemed to be pretty strong when it did what it needed to do.

Other post natal supports may cost more, but you truly get what you pay for on this one- and you don't get much. I had to go out and buy another brand to support me after a couple of days- so this was wasted money.

I have noticed better results with the ornithine addition.  I read a little about it and there was no proven benefits from it however I have really noticed a difference.  I take 1 before a workout, playing softball or golf.  I will also take one after a workout as it tends to keep my muscles pumped up much longer.  I have seen better muscle strength and stamina from these.  I have also found that I am not as sore after hard workouts.  I've been able to hold mass and muscle strength over longer time periods since taking these.  Try them and see what you think, they're worth it i.m.o.

I play tennis and have deep cracks in my heels, and hard skin on my toes and sides of my feet. The foot file and foot deo get rid of both and keep it away - I use it daily because I play tennis five days a week. Now, I love wearing sandals in summer, because me feet look so beautiful and well taken care of. I highly recommend these products. I have tried many other brands and they were all always disappointing. To me, the name Gehwol is a synonym for quality.

It's especially tough in winter, and this cuticle treatment is one of the few things I've found that works! My cuticles have been easier to trim, I don't know if I'd say it exfoliates, but it certainly keeps them soft and I don't get as many painful hangnails. I use it every time I wash my hands, and if I forget, it becomes PAINFULLY obvious! I'd definitely reccommend this for anyone whose hands gets really dry, especially if you like to keep your nails painted.

It did not do anything for me, but it did reduce my headaches and the night version helped me fall asleep. I found tea to be more effective in improving my sore throat, congestion, and cough. This product might work for others, but I personally will not purchase it again.

I have used it as a regular conditioner after each shampoo (shampoos of different brands) and also for deep conditioning 1-2X/week. My hair is thick, wavy and below the shoulder.$@$@Several years ago, my scalp would get irritated after being colored - itching, flaky.  Products recommended by a dermatologist didn't help and only made my hair dry.  Once my stylist recommended this product to me, my scalp became much calmer. I adjust use depending on how my scalp feels and the climate conditions, e.g. desert vs. humid.$@$@Paul Mitchell also has a regular Tea Tree conditioner.

Perhaps a long, thin plastic tip would be useful in application to the scalp.  I have my fingers crossed, hoping for some improvement in my hair (before I go bald!).

Other salts we also use are 'real salt', Kosher coarse salt and iodized Morton's salt.  Still there is a place in my kitchen and at the table for this lovely, flavorful salt.  I recommend it highly.

I live in an area with heavily chlorinated water, and even with a filter on my shower, my head is still itchy and dry, and my hair is dull, sticky, and limp....without this shampoo.  I have tried other clarifiers, but none work as well as this does. My hair is naturally very oily anyway, so I wash it every morning, and using this shampoo makes it soft, shiny, and clean from roots to ends, and it stays that way all day.  It can be a bit drying, so I recommend using it with the lightweight Malibu conditioner-just a little on the ends, and you're good.  This product has been a lifesaver, and I now only use other shampoos when I have no choice!

When it's closed it's supposed to be a kabuki but I feel like it's still better for blush even closed because to me a kabuki brush is flat which deposits the makeup into your skin as opposed to swiping color across the cheek. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are looking for a compact blush brush. If you are searching for a true kabuki brush try something else. Just because it's short doesn't mean it's a kabuki.

I used it several times exactly as directed and it did absolutely nothing. I've had better results with Freeman's clay mask and I could have bought enough of that to last me a lifetime for what I paid for this junk. Too bad I waited too long to call Drugstore.com and complain...although their return policy states nothing can be returned that has been opened so I probably wouldn't have been able to get a refund even if I had called within 30 days. I'm disgusted that I wasted so much money on what amounts to snakeoil. I hope by posting this review I

But I do like the feel of my skin after using it, it is softer after use. I use it a couple of times a week and rotate with the scrub. And I am happy with the combo of the two together. I will continue to use for probably another month to see if I have lasting results.

I love this over the second loved Clinique Exfoliating Scrub because Vichy one has a wonderfully pleasant smell which is exactly like the light fragrance of unripe green apricot.

We have granite counters and the food used to get really cold almost immediately, as the granite sucks the heat out of whatever it us touching. We just fill the plate with hot water from our kettle and it keeps his food warm until he decides he's done eating. It also has a grippy-type bottom so it doesn't slide around. I wouldn't put boiling water in it though because it can get really hot to the touch.

Maybe it was user error or maybe it only works on very young babies with thinner skin and more blood flow.  But I tried it several times all over the temple on all of us and could not get an accurate temperature result.

The cleanser is effective and doesn't cause my skin to dry out or breakout.

I'm so glad I did. It is possibly the best mascara I've ever tried. Granted the price has to do with both the brand & the amount you get per tube. Standard mascaras have almost twice as much product in the vial, but I think that is where their downfall lies. I don't have to clean off or remove excess product (which is wasted) from the brush, and having less product logically means the likelihood of bacterial growth  is decreased. Thus I'll run out of product and waste less of it before it would expire anyway. The brush is a basic corkscrew. The product doesn't smell, goes on beautifully even for someone very unskille

I had to wash it twice to get the build up off my hair.  I will admit that I condition heavily because my hair is long and tangles easily but once I got the build up off I put about a quarter size amount in my hand and work it through my hair and it works awesome.  So if you have damaged hair you can use a lot and if you don't you use a little.  Either way the product is awesome and I love it.

I usually can't comb my hair on day 30 because it is so nappy, but using these products has allowed me to go 2 months without a relaxer, which is much healthier for my hair.

I probably won't purchase these again because I don't want to deal with that."

She bought this when she couldn't find the hand cream as the tube is the exact same size.  I compared the ingredient list to the hand cream I had, and they are identical.  The texture is the same, though my one tube feels a tiny, tiny bit thinner. But I would sometimes notice that happening with different tubes of the hand cream also.

Only way to use this is to set your hair carefully, and then remain absolutely still for 10 minutes.

I like it much better than most expensive scrubs I've tried.

I can safely say that this one should be at the top of any curly girl's list. It's in a convenient, cap-less bottle; easy to use while shower detangling.  Pair this with a sturdy, wide-tooth detangling comb and a little steam, and you've got yourself a true winner. The scent is so pleasant and fresh, (fruity-floral) while the conditioner itself is truly smoothing and emollient. Granted, every woman's hair texture is different -- but for this thick, low-porosity,  3c/4a curly hair, it SAVES.  Great slip, and for the amount you get for such a low price, you can really go ape. =) All in all, worth trying if you suffer with fussy, dry curls like me. I've even replaced my tried and true Aussi

Now the label focuses on Hair, Skin & Nails and rather than the routine dosage being 2 gummies it is 3 gummies to deliver the stated ingredients at the dosage levels noted. Other than for marketing reasons, why was this necessary? I already take 6-8 other gummies at a time, why should this dosage be altered to require 3 gummies - and - it tastes the same and is still slightly gritty (calcium phosphate, no doubt).
